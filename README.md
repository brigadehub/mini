### In a nutshell

BrigadeHub is an **beta** stage data portal for volunteer coding organizations. While being built for Code for America Brigades, it can be be used for any project-based coding organization. It's being built to consolidate the efforts of maintaining a brigade's information into a single location, to distribute the task of content creation across the various non-technical brigade roles, and to enhance the experience of both members and admins of these unique organizations.

For a complete top-down view of the roadmap, take a look at our active ***[Roadmap Wiki](https://github.com/brigadehub/brigadehub/wiki/Roadmap)***.
